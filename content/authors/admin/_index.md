I am a machine learning researcher in the Machine Learning Research group at Morgan Stanley. I have diverse research interests in the area of machine learning, with particular interest in causal machine learning, data-driven decision making, reinforcement learning, econometrics, and probabilistic machine learning. Before that, I was a PhD student at Cornell University in the Computer Science department, supervised by [Nathan Kallus](http://www.nathankallus.com/).
