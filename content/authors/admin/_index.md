I am a fourth year PhD student at Cornell University in the Computer Science department, supervised by [Nathan Kallus](http://www.nathankallus.com/). My current research focus is at the intersection of causal inference, machine learning, and econometrics, with particular interest in causal inference under unmeasured confounding, reinforcement learning, and efficiently solving high-dimensional conditional moment problems. Previously, during my Masters at the University of Melbourne, I conducted research in Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics.
