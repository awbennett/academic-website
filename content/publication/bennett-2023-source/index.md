abstract: '''
    We consider estimation of parameters defined as linear functionals of
    solutions to linear inverse problems. Any such parameter admits a doubly
    robust representation that depends on the solution to a dual linear
    inverse problem, where the dual solution can be thought as a
    generalization of the inverse propensity function. We provide the first
    source condition double robust inference method that ensures asymptotic
    normality around the parameter of interest as long as either the primal or
    the dual inverse problem is sufficiently well-posed, without knowledge of
    which inverse problem is the more well-posed one. Our result is enabled by
    novel guarantees for iterated Tikhonov regularized adversarial estimators
    for linear inverse problems, over general hypothesis spaces, which are
    developments of independent interest.'''
