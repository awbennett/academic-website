abstract: '''
    There has recently been a lot of interest in unsupervised methods for
    learning sense distributions, particularly in applications where sense
    distinctions are needed. This paper analyses a state-of-the-art method
    for sense distribution learning, and optimises it for application to the
    entire vocabulary of a given language. The optimised method is then used
    to produce LexSemTM: a sense frequency and semantic dataset of
    unprecedented size, spanning approximately 88% of polysemous, English
    simplex lemmas, which is released as a public resource to the community.
    Finally, the quality of this data is investigated, and the LexSemTM sense
    distributions are shown to be superior to those based on the WORDNET first
    sense for lemmas missing from SemCor, and at least on par with SemCor-based
    distributions otherwise.'''
