abstract: '''
    Community question answering (cQA) forums provide a rich source of data
    for facilitating non-factoid question answering over many technical
    domains. Given this, there is considerable interest in answer retrieval
    from these kinds of forums. However this is a difficult task as the
    structure of these forums is very rich, and both metadata and text features
    are important for successful retrieval. While there has recently been
    a lot of work on solving this problem using deep learning models applied
    to question/answer text, this work has not looked at how to make use of
    the rich metadata available in cQA forums. We propose an attention-based
    model which achieves state-of-the-art results for text-based answer
    selection alone, and by making use of complementary meta-data, achieves
    a substantially higher result over two reference datasets novel to this
    work.'''
